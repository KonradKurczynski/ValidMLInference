# ValidMLInference

`ValidMLInference` is a Python package for correcting bias and performing valid inference in regressions that include variables generated by AI/ML methods. The bias-correction methods are described in [Battaglia, Christensen, Hansen & Sacher (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15585). 

## Requirements and installation

`ValidMLInference` runs on Python 3.8 and requires standard numerical packages: `numpy`, `scipy`, `jax`, `jaxopt`, and `numdifftools`. 

To install the package, run 
```
pip install ValidMLInference
```
in your terminal. 

## Using ValidMLInference

To get started, we recommend looking at the following examples and resources: 
1. [**Remote Work**](https://github.com/KonradKurczynski/ValidMLInference/blob/main/remote_work.ipynb): This notebook estimates the association between working from home and salaries using real-world job postings data [(Hansen et al., 2023)](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4380734). It illustrates how the functions `ols_bca`, `ols_bcm` and `one_step` can be used to correct bias from regressing on AI/ML-generated labels. The notebook reproduces results from Table 1 of [Battaglia, Christensen, Hansen & Sacher (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15585).
2. [**Topic Models**](https://github.com/KonradKurczynski/ValidMLInference/blob/main/topic_model_example.ipynb): This notebook estimates the association between CEO time allocation and firm performance [(Bandiera et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1086/705331). It illustrates how the functions `ols_bca_topic` and `ols_bcm_topic` can be used to correct bias from estimated topic model shares. The notebook reproduces results from Table 2 of [Battaglia, Christensen, Hansen & Sacher (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15585).
3. [**Synthetic Example**](https://github.com/KonradKurczynski/ValidMLInference/blob/main/synthetic_example.ipynb): A synthetic example comparing the performance of different bias-correction methods in the context of AI/ML-generated labels.
4. [**Functionality**](https://github.com/KonradKurczynski/ValidMLInference/blob/main/functionality.md): A detailed reference describing all available functions, optional arguments, and usage tips.
